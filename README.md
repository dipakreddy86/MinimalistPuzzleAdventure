# Minimalist Puzzle Adventure

A clean, low-fi puzzle game for Android that emphasizes intuitive controls and innovative physics/logic puzzles.

## Concept

Minimalist Puzzle Adventure features elegant design with simple visuals but deep gameplay. Players navigate through a series of increasingly challenging puzzles using intuitive touch controls. The game focuses on providing satisfying "aha!" moments through clever puzzle design rather than complex graphics.

## Features

- Clean, minimalist aesthetic with a focus on shapes and subtle animations
- Intuitive touch controls (tap, drag, rotate, pinch)
- Progressive difficulty curve with new mechanics introduced gradually
- Physics-based and logic puzzles that encourage creative thinking
- Soothing ambient soundtrack and subtle sound effects
- No ads, timers, or intrusive elements - just pure puzzle solving

## Development

This project is built using:
- Kotlin
- Android Jetpack libraries
- Custom physics implementation

## Installation

The game requires Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.
